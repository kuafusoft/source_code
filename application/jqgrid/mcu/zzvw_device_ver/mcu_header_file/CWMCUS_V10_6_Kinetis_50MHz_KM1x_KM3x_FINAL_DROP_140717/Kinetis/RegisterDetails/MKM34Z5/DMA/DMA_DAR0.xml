      <description>Each DAR contains the byte address used by the DMA controller to write data. The DARn is typically aligned on a 0-modulo-dsize boundary-that is, on the natural alignment of the destination data. Bits 31-20 of this register must be written with one of only four allowed values. Each of these four allowed values corresponds to a valid region of the device&apos;s memory map. The allowed values are: 0x000x_xxxx 0x1FFx_xxxx 0x200x_xxxx 0x400x_xxxx After being written with one of the allowed values, bits 31-20 read back as the written value. After being written with any other value, bits 31-20 read back as an indeterminate value.</description>
